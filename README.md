Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

ðŸ“„ Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions using a highly imbalanced dataset of credit card transactions. The dataset contains anonymized features due to confidentiality concerns, and principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce dimensionality.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To build a machine learning model that identifies fraudulent credit card transactions accurately, helping prevent unauthorized charges for customers.

ðŸ“Š Dataset Information
Context: The dataset contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013 over a period of two days.
Size: 284,807 transactions, with 492 identified as fraudulent (0.172% of the total dataset).
Features:
Time: Time in seconds from the first transaction.
Amount: Transaction amount.
V1 to V28: Principal components obtained through PCA.
Class: 1 indicates fraud, 0 indicates normal transaction.
